# Global-Air-Quality-with-Machine-Learning

Air pollution is a pressing environmental issue with significant implications for public health, ecosystems, and climate change. This project aims to analyze global air pollution trends using real-world air quality data. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, we seek to gain insights into pollution patterns, identify hotspots of contamination, and assess the impact of various pollutants on air quality.
